    "### Q1. What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** \n",
    "- **Eigenvalues** are scalars that represent how the transformation defined by a matrix stretches or compresses a vector.\n",
    "- **Eigenvectors** are vectors that, when transformed by a matrix, only change in magnitude, not direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigen-Decomposition:** Eigen-Decomposition involves breaking down a square matrix \\( A \\) into three components: \\( A = Q \\cdot \\Lambda \\cdot Q^{-1} \\), where \\( Q \\) is a matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of \\( A \\) and \\( \\Lambda \\) is a diagonal matrix containing the corresponding eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "Consider a matrix \\( A = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n",
    "1. Calculate eigenvalues: \\( \\text{det}(A - \\lambda I) = 0 \\) gives \\( \\lambda_1 = 5 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 = 2 \\).\n",
    "2. Find eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n",
    "   - For \\( \\lambda_1 = 5 \\), the corresponding eigenvector is \\( v_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n",
    "   - For \\( \\lambda_2 = 2 \\), the corresponding eigenvector is \\( v_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n",
    "3. Form \\( Q \\) using eigenvectors and \\( \\Lambda \\) using eigenvalues:\n",
    "   \\( Q = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) and \\( \\Lambda = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is eigen-decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigen-Decomposition:** Eigen-decomposition is a method to decompose a square matrix into eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It's significant because it simplifies complex matrix operations and allows expressing matrix transformations in terms of simpler operations on diagonal matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditions for Diagonalizability:** \n",
    "- The matrix must have \\( n \\) linearly independent eigenvectors, where \\( n \\) is the size of the matrix.\n",
    "- If the matrix has \\( n \\) distinct eigenvalues, it's guaranteed to be diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof Sketch:** Suppose \\( A \\) has \\( n \\) linearly independent eigenvectors. Construct matrix \\( Q \\) using these eigenvectors. If \\( Q^{-1} \\) exists, then \\( A = Q \\cdot \\Lambda \\cdot Q^{-1} \\), and \\( A \\) is diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach? How is it related to the diagonalizability of a matrix? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spectral Theorem:** It states that for certain classes of matrices (symmetric, Hermitian), a matrix can be decomposed into eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It's critical because it assures that for these matrices, eigen-decomposition is always possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* A symmetric matrix, like a covariance matrix, is guaranteed to have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, ensuring diagonalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding Eigenvalues:** Calculate eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation \\( \\text{det}(A - \\lambda I) = 0 \\), where \\( A \\) is the matrix and \\( \\lambda \\) is the eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representation:** Eigenvalues quantify how a matrix stretches or compresses space along its eigenvectors. They are fundamental in understanding transformations applied by matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. What are eigenvectors and how are they related to eigenvalues?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigenvectors:** Eigenvectors are vectors that, when transformed by a matrix, only change in magnitude, not direction. They represent the directions along which a linear transformation acts by scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship:** Eigenvectors associated with a matrix's eigenvalues define the directions along which the transformation represented by the matrix has specific effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Interpretation:** \n",
    "- **Eigenvectors:** They represent the directions that are only scaled by the matrix without changing direction. They're like the axes of stretching or compression.\n",
    "- **Eigenvalues:** They represent the scaling factor by which the eigenvectors are stretched or compressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. What are some real-world applications of eigen decomposition?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Dimensionality reduction technique.\n",
    "- **Image Compression:** Used in image processing for compression algorithms.\n",
    "- **Quantum Mechanics:** Solving problems related to quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9. Can a matrix have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unique Eigenvectors:** A matrix can have multiple sets of eigenvalues, but for distinct eigenvalues, the corresponding eigenvectors will be unique. For repeated eigenvalues, there might be multiple linearly independent eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10. In what ways is the Eigen-Decomposition approach useful in data analysis and machine learning? Discuss at least three specific applications or techniques that rely on Eigen-Decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Utilization in Machine Learning:**\n",
    "- **PCA:** Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "- **Eigenfaces:** Facial recognition systems.\n",
    "- **Spectral Clustering:** Grouping data points based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a similarity matrix.\n",
